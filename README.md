### Overview

Main goal of this repository is to be able automatically re-connect to rabbitmq and resume consuming messages.

- [x] auto-reconnection
- [x] restore-consumers

All connection, publishing, consuming logic here are just handy wrappers of https://github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go. I assume
that you have a good understanding of rabbitmq and leave you a full example of how it may look like in your
project in `cmd` directory. Otherwise, start learning here: https://rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html

### Install

```shell
go get -u github.com/komron-m/rabbitmq
```
